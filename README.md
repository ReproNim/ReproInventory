# ReproInventory
A repo for developing the ReproNim inventory of training resources.

# Background
**ReproNim** has developed a lot of [training resources](https://www.repronim.org/teach.html). 
The **[INCF-ReproNim Fellows](https://www.repronim.org/fellowship.html)** have developed a lot of [training resources](https://www.repronim.org/fellows-resources).
The community (neuroimaging and beyond) have developed a lot of training resources. When a user is faced with the 
desire to 'teach' a topic, how do they navigate all this content to find (or adapt, as needed) the right resources 
to start from?

We seek to create a ***ReproNim Inventory of Training Resources*** to help find what's out there so that users can more efficiently 
identify, reuse and adapt existing resources instead of always starting from scratch.

## Similar Efforts
We know of a number of existing resources that have attempted to do parts of this. These include (but are not limited to):
* [ReproRehabDB](https://reprorehabdb.usc.edu/)
* [LearnNeuroimaging/Hitchhacker's guide to the brain](https://learn-neuroimaging.github.io/hitchhackers_guide_brain/)
* [NITRC Training Resource Query](https://www.nitrc.org/search/?type_of_search=group&q=training)
* And many more! (add your faviorites here!)
